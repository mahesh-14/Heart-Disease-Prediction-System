# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System

# Overview
This project aims to develop a web-based application for predicting heart disease risk using machine learning techniques. Users can input various health parameters, and the system provides predictions based on a trained model.

# Project Objectives
1. Collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive heart disease dataset, ensuring data quality and completeness.
2. Evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to determine which algorithm provides the highest accuracy in predicting heart diseases.
3. Developing a user-friendly web-based application that allows users to input their health information and receive a heart disease risk prediction based on the selected best-performing algorithm.

#Features
•	User registration and login functionality.
•	Prediction form for inputting health parameters.
•	Results page displaying the prediction outcome.
•	Thorough testing and validation procedures.
